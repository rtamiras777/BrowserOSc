#1 Create a New section in the Agent called vision mode that will be a copy of the current Agent Mode (have the 2 sections about vision and integrate into AWS) It should be available in the lower section of the agent where there is "Chat Mode, Agent Mode, Teach Mode" now there shhould be Vision Mode.

When someone clicks on Vision Mode it should navigate to a dashboard that the user specifies and function as an "always on agent" essentially it should screen shot the entire dashboard and be fed to a pipeline that will run MinerU on it and some other analysis (to be done later) for now all it needs to do is go to the dashboard the user specifies (and ask the user for the time range) then screen shot the images and save it to downloads for now..

By the end of the buidl there should be:

when I upload agent as an extension there should be a vision mode at the bottom
button to click dashboard analysis
human is prompted what dashboard would you like to see
I provide dashboard 
Agent goes to the dashboard and screenshots the content and downloads the images for now

After each step STOP and let me test the new implentation
